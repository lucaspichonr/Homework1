## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company's mission is to drive economic freedome across the world. The first step to achieve that was to make it easy for everyone to use cryptocurrencies. Since cryptocurrencies are censorship resistance, permisionless and in some cases 'harder money', it can work as a viable alternative for many people in countries that face severe economic freedom challenges. The only thing they neeed is a mobile device and an internet connection.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The company noawadays serves a sleuth of customers from different profiles. It started by offering an easier way to acquire cryptocurrency for the retail investor but quickly grew up to develop more sophisticated tools suitable for professional investors and institutions. Their latest report indicated they have 56 million verified users and over $223 Billion in their platform.
What started as appealing to people with an ease to understand technology and cryptography then migrated into a movement mostly amongst millennials. Nowadays we are seeing large institutions start to adopt cryptocurrencies as assets in their balance sheet or investment portfolio. Many of the latter leverage Coinbase's offerings either for OTC deals, custody or trading.
Since Coinbase's goal is to develop an open financial system for everyone, the target is extremely ambitious.
Coinbase has a track record, mostly in the US, as the go-to place to acquire cryptoassets. It has a history of being a secure and reputable exchange without suffering any major hack so far. The focus on UX to make it easy for everyone gave them an advantage that helped them gain market share, but the surge of companies such as Square and Robinhood allowing customers easily acquire crypto via their platform is most likely hurting them onboard new customers at a higher rate, especially those who only want exposure to gains instead of being able to move it around. Coinbase has mostly focused on remaining compliant with government regulations and go above and beyond to make sure their operations are not harmed by legal issues. This has pros and cons, as it makes them a strong business with lower compliance risks than other companies in the space but also slows them to adopt and embrace new opportunities.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 
Coinbase currently has $223 billion worth of crypto assets on their platform, representing 11.3% of the crypto asset market share. Having onboarded over 56 million verified users into the crypto world, this has definitely been a success in terms of kicking off the open descentralized financial system they are pursuing in their mission statement. Trading is limited to only some countries, but the Coinbase Wallet is available to everyone and some features such as Vaults to add security are also avaialble to anyone. Coinbase treads lightly in terms of adding new services mostly to be extremely cautious from a compliance standpoint. This sometimes slows them down but according to them it's to make sure they can continue their operations in the long run, sometimes at the expense of shorter term revenue opportunities.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
1) Yield generating savings accounts such as the ones that Blockfi offers. Coinbase Ventures has a stake in Ledn but it's a separate company and still far from the brand umbrella. It also requires a separate signup and KYC process.
2) Options market: such as the one that Deribit and LedgerX offer. This would allow for many sophisticated investors to hedge their positions or generate yield from assets they already have.
3) Tokenized stocks such as the ones offered by FTX and Binance in order to show how blockchain can set the stage for a 24/7 market not only on crypto but also for stocks and other financial instruments.
4) Defi connector with easy UI. Back to their main advantage back in the days, the ease of use made them grow in market share. Now that many companies offer easy ways to acquire crypto, I think the next step for Coinbase is to make it easy to access Defi protocols with a couple taps so you can start generating yield. Something similar to what Dharma HQ just launched where you can connect you bank account and send funds directly to liquidity pools on Defi protocols.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This should help them maintain leader status by increasing coverage for financial needs within the crypto ecosystem. Otherwise, the lead generated by ease of use will eventually be obsolete because most competitors can provide similar experiences on top of a more complete set of solutions such as yield, options, defi ease of use, etc.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
- Blockchain / Ethereum, Solana, BSC
- Lending markets
- Matching engines for less liquid markets
- Google Cloud / AWS

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Leaning on the above will allow them to connect with different Defi providers while remaining agnostic to which chain is the 'right' one and risking a divide in the community incentivizing people to take sides or migrate to other exchanges. Matching engines and services such as the one that Paradigm offers for Deribit options market would be a great addition in order to allow block trades for volume in less liquid markets like the crypto options market.
Lastly, leveraging powerful cloud servers without the need to invest in hardware for volatile demands in computer processing can be a great way to avoid unnecessary costs and stale computing usage when trading volume decreases.
